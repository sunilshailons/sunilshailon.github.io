Hi, Iâ€™m **Sunil Shailons** ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a hardware design engineer passionate about **electronics systems design, signal integrity, FPGA prototyping, and embedded systems**.  

This site is my space to share:
- Blog posts on **electronics concepts**
- My **mini projects**
- Notes on debugging, PCB layout, and hardware tricks  

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about financial markets ðŸ“ˆ, exploring tech, and tinkering with DIY hardware projects.
