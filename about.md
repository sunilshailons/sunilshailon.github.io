### About Me

I am Sunil Shailon, a Senior R&D Engineer with over 6.8 years of experience in the telecommunications space. My expertise lies in driving hardware design and FPGA bring-up for high-speed telecom systems. I am a results-oriented professional with a proven track record of optimizing processes and delivering significant impact on complex projects.

Throughout my career at Tejas Networks and VVDN Technologies, I have gained hands-on experience in the complete product life-cycle, from initial schematic design and signal/power integrity simulations to PCB layout and board bring-up. I am skilled in designing complex high-speed boards and have successfully managed projects involving carrier Ethernet fabric cards and universal line cards with switching capacities up to 2.4T.

A key strength of mine is my ability to accelerate development cycles. I have authored and automated over 120 ATE test cases in VHDL/Verilog, which has helped to accelerate control-plane FPGA validation by 30%. This focus on automation and efficiency has also contributed to a 25% reduction in board bring-up time.

I am passionate about building robust, high-performance systems and am always looking for new challenges to push the boundaries of technology. My goal is to continue contributing to innovative R&D projects that have a tangible impact on the future of telecommunications.
