### Featured Projects

#### **Next Gen Carrier Switching Fabric Card**
* **Duration:** March 2024 - Current
* **Summary:** A central switching fabric card with 2.4T capacity.
* **My Role:** I was responsible for the complete schematic design, power tree design, board design, FPGA implementation, cross-platform functional analysis, and signal, power, and clock tree design.

#### **Universal Line Card**
* **Duration:** August 2023 - March 2024
* **Summary:** A 2U line card with 400G switching capacity inside a 9U chassis.
* **My Role:** I implemented FPGA PMBUS FSM logic onto a PCIe Switch to trigger switchover functionality for US ports between two central switch cards. I also handled board bring-up and validation.

#### **Carrier Ethernet Fabric Card**
* **Duration:** June 2022 - June 2023
* **Summary:** A fabric card with 64G switching capacity inside a 4U chassis.
* **My Role:** My responsibilities included the complete schematic and board design, FPGA implementation, cross-platform functional analysis, Signal and Power Integrity Simulations, and Clock Tree design.

#### **High-Speed Cards & Other Hardware**
* **Duration:** September 2018 - May 2021 (at VVDN Technologies)
* **Summary:** During my time at VVDN, I worked on several high-speed hardware projects, including bringing up high-speed cards with DDR4 SI simulation, designing PSE controllers, and developing a smart water heater board with a watchdog reset.
